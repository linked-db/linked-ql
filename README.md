❄️ **_Save the overhead working with SQL and structured data - from the time and effort spent figuring out relational queries to the labour managing schemas!_** Try a modern, minimalistic take on SQL and databases in general!

Linked QL is a DB query client that simplfies how you interact with your database and manage your schemas.

💥 Takes the ORM and friends out of the way and let's you just write SQL, but SQL that you will actually enjoy. (Linked QL extends standard SQL with [new syntax sugars](#introducing-magic-paths) that let you write relational queries in 50% less code and without a single JOIN clause.)

⚡️ Takes the process out of schema management and lets you just *ALTER* away your DB, but in a safety net. (Linked QL extends your DB behind the scenes to [automatically version](#introducing-auto-versioning) each edit you make and have them kept as "savepoints" that you can always rollback to.)

💥 Brings the "schema-as-code" paradigm to its true meaning and essentially lets you have your entire DB structure go in a single [`schema.json` file](#re-introducing-schema-as-code-with-schemajson) that you edit in-place, as against the "hundreds of migration files" story. (Linked QL essentially rewrites that story.)

It comes as a small library and is usable over your DB of choice - from the server-side Postgres and MySQL, to the client-side [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API), to the plain JSON object!

## Setup

Install Linked QL:

```cmd
npm install @linked-db/linked-ql
```

Obtain the Linked QL client for your target database:

1. For SQL databases, install the regular SQL client you use for your DB. (Typically, `pg` for Postgres, `mysql2` for MySQL databases.)

    Given a Postgres DB, install the `pg` client:

    ```cmd
    npm install pg
    ```

    Use Linked QL as a wrapper over that:

    ```js
    // Import pg and LinkedQl
    import pg from 'pg';
    import LinkedQl from '@linked-db/linked-ql/sql';

    // Connect pg
    const pgClient = new pg.Client({
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 5432,
    });
    await pgClient.connect();

    // Use LinkedQl as a wrapper over that
    const client = new LinkedQl(pgClient, { dialect: 'postgres' });
    ```
    
2. For the client-side *IndexedDB*, import and instantiate the *IDB* client. _(Coming soon)_
    
    ```js
    // Import IDB as LinkedQl
    import LinkedQl from '@linked-db/linked-ql/idb';
    
    // Create an instance.
    const client = new LinkedQl;
    ```
    
3. To work with Linked QL's in-memory object storage, import and instantiate the *ODB* client. _(Coming soon)_

    ```js
    // Import ODB as LinkedQl
    import LinkedQl from '@linked-db/linked-ql';
    
    // Create an instance.
    const LinkedQlClient = new LinkedQl;
    ```

All `client` instances above implement the same interface:

```js
client.query('SELECT fname, lname FROM users WHERE role = $1', { params: ['admin'] }).then(result => {
    console.log(result);
});
```

```js
const result = await client.query('SELECT fname, lname FROM users WHERE role = $1', { params: ['admin'] });
console.log(result);
```

Other APIs are covered just ahead in the [API](#linked-ql-api) section.

## Introducing Magic Paths

💥 *Express relationships graphically.*

JOINS can be good, but can be a curse too, as they almost always obfuscate your entire query! But what if you didn't have to write JOINS to express certain relationships?

Meet Linked QL's magic path operators, a syntax extension to SQL, that lets you connect to columns on other tables without writing a single JOIN. Linked QL uses heuristics on your DB structure to figure out the details and the relevant JOINs behind the scenes.

Where you normally would write...

```sql
-- Regular SQL
SELECT title, users.fname AS author_name FROM posts
LEFT JOIN users ON users.id = posts.author
```

Linked QL lets you draw a path to express the relationship:

```sql
-- Linked QL
SELECT title, author ~> fname AS author_name FROM posts
```

And here's a scenario showing a typical schema and an example query each:

```sql
-- The users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id int primary key generated always as identity,
    title varchar,
    name varchar,
    role int references roles (id),
    created_time timestamp
);
-- The books table
CREATE TABLE books (
    id int primary key generated always as identity,
    title varchar,
    content varchar,
    author int references users (id),
    created_time timestamp
);
```

```sql
-- Regular SQL
SELECT book.id, book.title, content, book.created_time, user.id AS author_id, user.title AS author_title, user.name AS author_name 
FROM books AS book LEFT JOIN users AS user ON user.id = book.author
```

```sql
-- Linked QL
SELECT id, title, content, created_time, author ~> id, author ~> title, author ~> name 
FROM books
```

✨ PRO: *About 50% code, and whole namespacing exercise, now eliminated; all with zero upfront setup!*

Taking that further, paths can be multi-level:

```sql
-- Linked QL
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE author ~> role ~> name = 'admin'
```

and they can also be used to express incoming references:

```sql
-- Linked QL
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE author <~ books ~> title = 'Beauty and the Beast'
```

## Introducing Auto-Versioning

⚡️ *Create, Alter, and Drop schemas without needing to worry about versioning.*

Databases have historically lacked the concept of versioning, and that has seen all of the engineering work pushed down to the client application. If you've ever had to adopt a special process for defining and managing your schemas, wherein changes are handled through *serially-named* files within your application, each written as an `UP`/`DOWN` pair of actions, and in all supported by tooling...

```sql
app
  ├─ migrations
  │ │
  │ ├─ 20240523_1759_create_users_table_and_drop_accounts_table
  │ │ │
  │ │ ├─ up.sql
  │ │ │    CREATE TABLE users (id INT, first_n...);
  │ │ │    DROP TABLE accounts;
  │ │ └─ down.sql
  │ │      DROP TABLE users;
  │ │      CREATE TABLE accounts (id INT, first_name VAR...);
  │ │
  │ ├─ 20240523_1760_add_last_login_to_users_table_and_rename_order_status_table
  │ │ │
  │ │ ├─ up.sql
  │ │ │    ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN last_lo...;
  │ │ │    ALTER TABLE order_status RENAME TO o...;
  │ │ └─ down.sql
  │ │      ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN last_login;
  │ │      ALTER TABLE order_tracking RENAME TO order_status;
  │ │
  │ ├─ +256 more...
```

then you've faced the problem that this defeciency in databases creates! But what if databases magically got to do the heavy lifting?

Meet Linked QL's little addition to your database that does exactly that and lets you just alter your DB however you may but in the safety net of some behind-the-scenes magic that snapshots your schema before each alteration! Meet Automatic Schema Savepoints and Rollbacks!

Linked QL:

```js
// Alter schema
const savepoint = await client.query('CREATE TABLE public.users (id int, name varchar)', {
    description: 'Create users table',
});
```

```js
// Inspect the automatic savepoint created for you
console.table(savepoint.description);   // Create users table
console.table(savepoint.versionTag);    // 1
console.table(savepoint.savepointDate); // 2024-07-17T22:40:56.786Z
```

*(More details in the [Savepoint](#the-savepoint-api) API.)*

✨ PRO: *Whole engineering work now essentially over to the DB where it rightly belongs; all with zero upfront setup!*

Taking that further, it gets nifty when it's time to rollback:

```js
// Rollback all associated changes (Gets the users table dropped)
await savepoint.rollback();
```

and you can go many levels back:

```js
// Rollback to public@3
let savepoint;
while(savepoint = await client.database('public').savepoint()) {
    await savepoint.rollback();
    if (savepoint.versionTag === 3) break;
}
```

and you can "undo" a rollback, or in other words, roll forward to a point in time:

```js
// "Undo" the last rollback (Gets the users table re-created)
let savepoint = await client.database('public').savepoint({ direction: 'forward' });
await savepoint.rollback();
```

You essentially are able to go *back in time* and *forward in time* as randomly as iteration demands.

## Re-Introducing Schema-as-Code with `schema.json`

💥 *Have your entire DB structure live in a single `schema.json` file that you edit in-place!*

With schema versioning now over to the database, much of the old conventions and formalities should now be irrelevant. We found that we could essentially streamline the whole "database" footprint from spanning hundreds of migration files to fitting into a single `schema.json` (or `schema.yml`) file!

### `schema.json`

```js
[
    {
        "name": "database_1",
        "tables": [] // Table objects
    },
    {
        "name": "database_2",
        "tables": [] // Table objects
    }
]
```

<details><summary>Explore the structure</summary>

An example table object:

```js
{
    "name": "users",
    "columns": [], // Column objects (minimum of 1)
    "constraints": [], // Constraint objects
    "indexes": [] // Index objects
}
```

An example column object:

```js
{
    "name": "id",
    "type": "int",
    "primaryKey": true,
    "identity": true
}
```

<details>
<summary>More column examples</summary>

```js
{
    "name": "full_name",
    "type": ["varchar","101"],
    "generated": "(first_name || ' ' || last_name)"
}
```

```js
{
    "name": "email",
    "type": ["varchar","50"],
    "uniqueKey": true,
    "notNull": true,
    "check": "(email ~* '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$')"
}
```

```js
{
    "name": "parent",
    "type": "int",
    "notNull": true,
    "references": {
        "targetTable": "users",
        "targetColumns": ["id"],
        "matchRull": "full",
        "updateRule": "cascade",
        "deleteRule": "restrict"
    }
}
```
</details>

An example constraint object:

```js
{
    "type": "PRIMARY_KEY",
    "columns": ["id"],
    "name": "constraint_name"
}
```

<details>
<summary>More constraint examples</summary>

```js
{
    "type": "UNIQUE_KEY",

    "targetTable": "users",
    "targetColumns": ["id"],
    "matchRull": "full",
    "updateRule": "cascade",
    "deleteRule": "restrict"
}
```

```js
{
    "type": "CHECK",
    "expr": "(email ~* '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$')"
}
```
</details>

An example index object:

```js
{
    "type": "FULLTEXT",
    "columns": ["full_name"]
}
```

<details>
<summary>More index examples</summary>

```js
{
    "type": "SPATIAL",
    "columns": ["full_name"]
}
```
</details>

</details>

Now, if you had that somewhere in your application, say at `./database/schema.json`, Linked QL could help keep it in sync both ways with your database:

+ you add or remove a database or table or column... and it is automatically reflected in your DB structure with a simple command: `linkedql migrate`
+ your colleague makes new changes from their codebase... and it is automatically reflected in your local copy with a simple command: `linkedql reflect`

You also get to see a version indicator on each database object in your schema essentially incrementing on each migrate operation (whether by you or by colleague), and decrementing on each rollback operation (whether by you or by colleague).

Thanks to a DB-native schema version control system, no need to maintain past states, or risk losing them; the DB now becomes the absolute source of truth for both itself and its client applications, as against the other way around. (You may want to see how that brings us to [true "Schema as Code" in practice](#test-heading).)

To setup:

1. Make a directory within your application for database concerns. Linked QL will look in `./database`, but you will be able to point to your preferred location when running Linked QL commands.

2. Have a `driver.js` file there that has a *default export* function that returns a Linked QL instance. This will be imported and used by Linked QL to interact with your database. This could look something like:

    ```js
    import pg from 'pg';
    import SQLClient from '@linked-db/linked-ql/sql';

    const pgClient = new pg.Client({
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 5432,
    });
    await pgClient.connect();
    const sqlClient = new SQLClient(pgClient, { dialect: 'postgres' });

    export default function() {
        return sqlClient;
    }
    ```

3. Have your schemas defined in a `schema.json` file in there. (See [`schema.json`](#schemajson) above as a guide.)

To run:

+ Use `linkedql migrate` to walk through your staged local changes and interactively perform a migration on your database.
+ Use `linkedql rollback` to walk through the latest savepoint at each database and interactively perform a rollback.
+ Use `linkedql leaderboard` to just view the latest savepoint at each database.

*(More details in the [Linked QL CLI](#linked-ql-cli) section.)*


<!--





**Now, you may simply edit any part of your schema in-place!** For example, you can add a new table by simply extending the tables list; a new column by simply extending the columns list; a new constraint by simply extending the constraints list. You can go on to change the respective objects at their respective property level! For example, you may remove a column-level constraint, say `uniqueKey`, by simply deleting it; or change the column type, or update the `check` constraint, by simply overwriting it.

*Changes are commited to your database at your next [`linkedql migrate`](#cmd-linkedql-migrate).*

**Names may be changed, but not in-place!** A "rename" operation - whether on a database object, a table object, a column object, a constraint object, or an index object - would need to be done via a new `$name` property:

```js
{
    "name": "old_name",
    "$name": "new_name"
}
```

*Your new name is picked up at your next [`linkedql migrate`](#cmd-linkedql-migrate), and the `$name` property automatically disappears.*

**Each `migrate` operation is automatically versioned and you can see that reflected in a `version` property for each database in your schema!** (The `version` property automatically appears for a database after the first `migrate` operation.) Now, you can roll back over a version, or over consecutive versions, at any time. And after rolling back, you can also roll forward!

*You may use [`linkedql savepoints`](#cmd-linkedql-savepoints) to preview the next savepoint at each database before each [`linkedql rollback`](#cmd-linkedql-rollback).*

Interesting yet? You may want to learn more about [Linked QL's unique take on Schema as Code](#) as a paradigm and a practice.

## Linked QL API

Here's for a quick overview of the Linked QL API:

Here we talk about the `client.query()` method in more detail along with other Linked QL APIs that essentially let us do the same things possible with `client.query()`, but this time, programmatically.

As an example of one of these APIs, a `CREATE DATABASE` operation...

```js
const savepoint = await client.query('CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS database_1');
```

could be programmatically achieved as:

```js
const savepoint = await client.createDatabase('database_1', { ifNotExists: true });
```

That said, while the `createDatabase()` method is associated with the base `Client` object, the different programmatic query APIs in Linked QL are actually organized into three hierarchical scopes:

+ the top-level scope (represented by the [`Client`](#the-client-api) interface), featuring methods such as: `createDatabase()`, `alterDatabase()`, `dropDatabase()`, `hasDatabase()`, `describeDatabase()`

+ the database-level scope (represented by a certain [`Database`](#the-database-api) interface), featuring methods such as: `createTable()`, `alterTable()`, `dropTable()`, `hasTable()`, `describeTable()`

+ the table-level scope (represented by a certain [`Table`](#the-table-api) interface), featuring methods such as: `select()`, `insert()`, `upsert()`, `update()`, `delete()`

Each object provides a way to narrow down to the next; e.g. from the top-level scope to a database scope...

```js
const database_1 = client.database('database_1');
```

and from there to a table scope:

```js
const table_1 = database.table('table_1');
```

These APIs at play would look something like:

```js
// Create database "database_1"
await client.createDatabase('database_1', { ifNotExists: true });
```

```js
// Enter "database_1" and create a table
await client.database('database_1').createTable({
    name: 'table_1', columns: [
        { name: 'column_1', type: 'int', identity: true, primaryKey: true },
        { name: 'column_2', type: 'varchar' },
        { name: 'column_3', type: 'varchar' },
    ]
});
```

```js
// Enter "table_1" and insert data
await client.database('database_1').table('table_1').insert({
    column_2: 'Column 2 test content',
    column_3: 'Column 3 test content',
});
```

These APIs and more are what's covered in this section.

<pre><code>client.query(sql: string, options?: Options): Promise&lt;Savepoint | Array&lt;object&gt;&gt;</code></pre></summary>

⚙️ Spec:

+ `sql` (string): an SQL query.
+ `options` (Options, *optional*): extra parameters for the query.
+ Return value: a [`Savepoint`](#the-savepoint-api) instance when it's a `CREATE`, `ALTER`, or `DROP` operation, but an array (the result set) when it's a `SELECT` query or when it's an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation that has a `RETURNING` clause.

##### ⚽️ Usage:

```js
const savepoint = await client.query('ALTER TABLE users RENAME TO accounts');
console.log(savepoint.versionTag); // number

await savepoint.rollback(); // true
```

or a SELECT query, and get back a result set:

```js
const rows = await client.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 4');
console.log(rows.length); // 1
```

or an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation with a `RETURNING` clause, and ge backt a result set:

<details><summary>
A single-word summary of the effect that rolling back to this savepoint will have on subject DB.
<pre><code>savepoint.rollbackEffect: (string, <i>readonly</i>)</code></pre></summary>

##### ⚽️ Usage:

Will rolling back to given savepoint mean dropping or re-creating the subject database?:

For a create operation...

```js
const savepoint = await client.createDatabase('test_db', { descripton: 'Create db' });
```
Rolling back will mean dropping the DB:

```js
console.log(savepoint.descripton); // Create db
console.log(savepoint.rollbackEffect); // DROP
```

```js
// Drop DB
await savepoint.rollback();
console.log(savepoint.rollbackEffect); // DROP
```

Having rolled back, rolling forward will mean a re-creation of the DB:

```js
// Find the same savepoint with a forward lookup
const savepoint = await client.database('test_db').savepoint({ direction: 'forward' });
// Now rolling back will mean re-creating the DB
console.log(savepoint.descripton); // Create db
console.log(savepoint.rollbackEffect); // CREATE
```

Compare with that of rolling back table-level operations - which always just has an `ALTER` effect:

```js
// Create table - which translates to a DB "alter" operation
const savepoint = await client.database('test_db').createTable({
    name: 'test_tbl2',
    columns: [],
}, { description: 'Create test_tbl2' });
// Rolling back will mean dropping the table - which will still translate to a DB "alter" operation
console.log(savepoint.descripton); // Create test_tbl2
console.log(savepoint.rollbackEffect); // ALTER
```

```js
// Drop DB
await savepoint.rollback();
console.log(savepoint.rollbackEffect); // ALTER
```

```js
// Find the same savepoint with a forward lookup
const savepoint = await client.database('test_db').savepoint({ direction: 'forward' });
// Now rolling back will mean re-creating the table - which will still translate to a DB "alter" operation
console.log(savepoint.descripton); // Create test_tbl2
console.log(savepoint.rollbackEffect); // ALTER
```

</details>

#### `savepoint.isNextPointInTime()`:

<details><summary>
Check if the savepoint is the next actual <i>point in time</i> for the database.
<pre><code>savepoint.isNextPointInTime(): Promise&lt;boolean&gt;</code></pre></summary>

⚙️ Spec:

+ Return value: boolean.

##### ⚽️ Usage:

For a new operation, that would be true:

```js
const dbCreationSavepoint = await client.createDatabase('test_db');
console.log(await dbCreationSavepoint.isNextPointInTime()); // true
```

But after having performed more operations, that wouldn't be:

```js
const tblCreationSavepoint = await client.database('test_db').createTable({
    name: 'test_tbl',
    columns: [{
        name: 'id',
        type: 'int'
    }]
});
console.log(await tblCreationSavepoint.isNextPointInTime()); // true
console.log(await dbCreationSavepoint.isNextPointInTime()); // false
```

Rollback table creation and test `dbCreationSavepoint`'s position again:

```js
await tblCreationSavepoint.rollback();
console.log(await tblCreationSavepoint.isNextPointInTime()); // false
console.log(await dbCreationSavepoint.isNextPointInTime()); // true
```

</details>

#### `savepoint.rollback()`:

<details><summary>

Create database and rollback:

```js
// Create DB
const savepoint = await client.createDatabase('test_db', { descripton: 'Create db' });
// Roll back - which means drop the DB
await savepoint.rollback();
```

Undo the rollback; i.e. roll forward:

```js
// Find the same savepoint with a forward lookup
const savepoint = await client.database('test_db').savepoint({ direction: 'forward' });
// Roll back - which means re-create the DB
await savepoint.rollback();
```

</details>

#### `savepoint.toJson()`:

<details><summary>
Get a plain object representation of the savepoint.
<pre><code>savepoint.toJson(): object</code></pre></summary>

        name: 'id',
        type: 'int'
    }]
});
console.log(savepoint.schema());

await savepoint.schema();
```

</details>

#### `savepoint.name()`:

<details><summary>
Get the subject database's name.
<pre><code>savepoint.name(postRollback?: boolean): string</code></pre></summary>

⚙️ Spec:

+ `postRollback` (boolean, *optional*): in case a name change was captured in the savepoint, whether to return the database's post-rollback name. Otherwise the database's active, pre-rollback name is returned.
+ Return value: the database name.

##### ⚽️ Usage:

## Linked QL CLI

Linked QL migrations are a **small** addition to Linked QL. And it comes ready-to-use, via the `linkedql` command, upon Linked QL's installation. (No extra setup is required.)

### Overview

The `linkedql` command comes as part of your local Linked QL installation and not as a global package, and that means you'll need the `npx` prefix to run the commands below. E.g.

```cmd
npx linkedql migrate
```

In each case, you can use the `--dir` flag to point Linked QL to your "database" directory:

```cmd
npx linkedql migrate --dir="./src/database-stuff"
```

*(Relative paths will resolve against your current working directory (CWD).)*

Use the `--db` flag to run the command for a specific database out of the list of databases:

```cmd
npx linkedql migrate --db=database_1
```

Use the flag `--auto` to turn off prompts and just take the "sensible-default" action:

```cmd
npx linkedql migrate --auto
```

### Commands

#### `linkedql migrate`

*Interactively run new migrations.* Linked QL looks through your local schema and compares with your active DB structure to see what's new. It works interactively by default and you're able to preview each SQL query to be run.

##### 🐹 Usage:

```cmd
npx linkedql migrate
```

```cmd
npx linkedql migrate --db=database_1
```

Use the `--desc` flag to provide the description for your new changes:

```cmd
npx linkedql migrate --desc="Initial DB creation"
```

Use the flag `--quiet` to turn off SQL previews:

```cmd
npx linkedql migrate --quiet
```

#### `linkedql rollback`

*Interactively perform a rollback.* Linked QL looks for the next savepoint at each database and initiates a rollback. It works interactively by default and you're able to preview each SQL query to be run.

##### 🐹 Usage:

```cmd
npx linkedql rollback
```

```cmd
npx linkedql rollback --db=database_1
```

Use the `--direction` flag to specify either a "backward" rollback (the default) or a "forward" rollback if already at a certain rollback state:

```cmd
npx linkedql rollback --direction=forward
```

Use the flag `--quiet` to turn off SQL previews:

```cmd
npx linkedql migrate --quiet
```

#### `linkedql leaderboard`

*View the latest savepoint at each database.* Linked QL displays details about the next savepoint at each database.

##### 🐹 Usage:

```cmd
npx linkedql leaderboard
```

```cmd
npx linkedql leaderboard --db=database_1
```

Use the flag `--direction` to specify either a "back in time" lookup (the default) or "forward in time" lookup if already at a certain rollback state:

```cmd
npx linkedql leaderboard --direction=forward
```

#### `linkedql erase`

*Permanently delete savepoint histories.* Linked QL deletes the savepoint history of each database. This is irreversible.

##### 🐹 Usage:

```cmd
npx linkedql erase
```

```cmd
npx linkedql erase --db=database_1
```

## Roadmap

+ Implement support for IndexedDB.
+ Implement the in-memory database.

> Much of that could happen sooner with your support! If you'd like to help out, please consider a [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/ox-harris). PRs are also always welcome.
