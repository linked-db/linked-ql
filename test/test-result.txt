    INNER JOIN
      ✔ should emit a single push when a matching row is pushed
      ✔ should emit a patch when a joined row is updated
      ✔ should emit a delete when a joined row is removed
    LEFT JOIN
      ✔ should emit a push with null padding when a left-side row is pushed
      ✔ should patch a null-padded row when a matching right-side row is pushed
      ✔ should patch a row back to null padding when a matching right-side row is deleted
    RIGHT JOIN
      ✔ should emit a push with null padding when a right-side row is pushed
      ✔ should patch a null-padded row when a matching left-side row is pushed
      ✔ should patch a row back to null padding when a matching left-side row is deleted
      ✔ should emit a delete when a right-side row is removed
    FULL JOIN
      ✔ should push a null-padded row for a left-side push
      ✔ should push a null-padded row for a right-side push
      ✔ should patch to a full join when a match is pushed
      ✔ should patch to null padding when a joined row is deleted
    CROSS JOIN
      ✔ should emit a new composite row for every existing row when a new row is pushed
    Special Joins (NATURAL/USING)
      ✔ should handle NATURAL JOIN by inferring common column `common_id`
      ✔ should handle multi-column USING JOIN on `id` and `common_id`
    Multi-Table Joins
      ✔ should correctly handle a 3-table INNER JOIN
